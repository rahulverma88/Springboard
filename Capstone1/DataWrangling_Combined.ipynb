    "The data for this capstone comes from multiple different sources. Each source has a different way for delivering data, and the data cleaning/wrangling procedures for each are also different.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of data sources considered here:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Historical local area unemployment data: This data was obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) website. Obtaining the data for each county, over many years, is however not trivial. One must use the BLS Public Data API, the code for which is given later in this notebook. One must also register on the BLS website, where they give you a API key so that large data queries can be handled. The data returned by this API was also very clean, with no missing/Nan values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Historical oil price data: This data was simply downloaded as a csv file from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) website. They aggregate the oil price by day, and there are some missing values in this data which need to be taken care of.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Oil and gas production data: We take the historical production for three states which currently produce most of US oil and gas - Texas, North Dakota and Oklahoma. The data is reported every month, by well. There are thousands of these oil wells, which are often abandoned for various reasons, including depletion of the oil field. In addition, there is a well index file associated with the data, which reports its latitude and longitude and the state/county in which it is located. For both North Dakota and Oklahoma, the data was obtained from Enigma's curated oil and gas data collection. Enigma obtained the data from each state's regulatory body for oil and gas. For Texas, the data on Enigma's website was incomplete (they report only the last 12 months). The full historical data was obtained as a raw data dump by emailing Enigma's helpline. They purchase the raw data from the Railroad Commission, and were happy to supply it to me. Thankfully, the oil and gas production data is well maintained for all the states, with no missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Historical local area workforce: this is the absolute number of people in the workforce in a given county, as opposed to the percentage of unemployed people. This data is also available from the BLS, with the appropriate API\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Macro-economic indicators: Since we are comparing local area unemployment with oil price, we should also take into account that some unemployment changes are due to the macro-economy, not just the oil price. For example, we see sharp increases in unemployment across the country in 2008 accompanied by sharp drops in oil price. This change is therefore not just due to oil price, but also due to wider economic recession. This data helps to separate out these effects."
